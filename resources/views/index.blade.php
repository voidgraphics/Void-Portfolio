				I am an ambitious 21 year-old from Belgium.
	I have a deep passion for crafting experiences for people through technology - be it websites or mobile &amp; desktop apps. My journey started by creating custom themes for Windows: modifying resource images in system files to give the userâ€™s computer a brand new look &amp; feel. I quickly fell in love with this concept, which led me to start studies in this field.
